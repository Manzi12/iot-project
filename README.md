# iot-project
this is my first IOT project,its about car to car communication .the cars are communicating using Mqtt protacol,which i tried to implement using sigfox and the adafruit but it failed and i ended up creating another version of it using the raspberry pi and the paho mqtt with python client,the code is in the working version folder.

with the paho,i could not control the data the way i wanted,so i changed again and used the pi,mqtt on the adafruit.and it worked perfectly all the source code and files are up git
